1. The first two are circles located in the upper-right and lower-right corners.

2. The third section is the area between these two circles.

3. The fourth section is the largest, covering the entire left area.

Upon pressing them, the display shows the following messages:

1. Releasing without moving away will activate them.

2. It indicates the elapsed time since the last training session.
